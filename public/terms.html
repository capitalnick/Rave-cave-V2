  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 23 February 2026</p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
  <p>By creating an account or using Rave Cave you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the service.</p>

  <h2>2. The Service</h2>
  <p>Rave Cave is an AI-powered wine cellar management tool. We provide wine identification, storage tracking, drinking window estimates, and personalised recommendations. AI outputs are informational and may not always be accurate.</p>

  <h2>3. Accounts</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 18 years old (or the legal drinking age in your jurisdiction) to use Rave Cave. You are responsible for keeping your account credentials secure.</p>

  <h2>4. Free &amp; Premium Tiers</h2>
  <p>The free tier allows up to 50 bottles. Premium features and pricing will be announced separately. We reserve the right to adjust tier limits with reasonable notice.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Content</h2>
  <p>You retain ownership of all data and images you upload. By using the service you grant us a limited licence to process your content solely to provide the service (e.g., AI analysis of label images).</p>

  <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Abuse rate limits or attempt to circumvent security measures.</li>
    <li>Use the service for any unlawful purpose.</li>
    <li>Reverse-engineer or scrape the service or its AI outputs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>The service is provided "as is". AI-generated recommendations, ratings, and drinking windows are estimates and should not be treated as professional advice. We are not liable for wine storage decisions made based on the service.</p>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Rave Cave's total liability is limited to the amount you have paid for the service in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>

  <h2>9. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms. You may delete your account at any time from Settings.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update these terms. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These terms are governed by the laws of New South Wales, Australia.</p>
