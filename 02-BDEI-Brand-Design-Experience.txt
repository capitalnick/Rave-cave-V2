RAVE CAVE — Creative Brief
Project Overview

RAVE CAVE is a personal wine cellar web app that reimagines how wine collections are viewed, explored and understood. It blends the ritual and reverence of a traditional cellar with the energy of contemporary culture, technology and underground design language.

This phase of the project focuses on elevating the brand and interface from a raw, neon-forward aesthetic into a more mature, gallery-grade experience — one that feels curated, intentional and collectible. The goal is not to tone RAVE CAVE down, but to give it discipline: neon as a statement, not a default.

The product should feel less like a nightclub UI and more like an exhibition catalogue for a private collection — bold, confident, editorial and culturally fluent.

Target Audience

Primary audience

Wine-literate enthusiasts and collectors

Digitally confident, design-aware users

People who enjoy systems, curation and personal archives

Likely to value craft, provenance and storytelling as much as data

They may not be sommeliers, but they care deeply about:

What they own

Why they own it

How it’s organised

How it feels to interact with their collection

Secondary audience

Design-curious users who don’t identify as “wine nerds” but are drawn in by the interface and tone

Users who might be intimidated by traditional wine software and are looking for something more human and expressive

Brand Strategy
Brand Mission

To transform wine collection management into a curated, expressive and culturally relevant experience — where data, taste and identity intersect.

RAVE CAVE exists to make owning wine feel intentional, personal and visually powerful, not transactional or clinical.

Audience Mindset

The audience is:

Proud of their collection, even if it’s modest

Curious, not dogmatic

Comfortable with contradiction (luxury + grit, data + emotion)

Slightly bored by traditional wine tools that feel corporate, beige or elitist

They want:

Control without rigidity

Information without intimidation

Beauty without pretence

They don’t want to be told what to like — they want tools that respect their taste.

Customer Value Proposition

RAVE CAVE turns your wine collection into a curated artefact — something you explore, reflect on and enjoy, not just track.

It replaces spreadsheet thinking with gallery thinking: every bottle has context, presence and meaning.

Simplified Value Proposition

“Your wine collection, curated like an exhibition.”

Brand Values (max 3)

Intentionality
Everything has a reason — colour, layout, hierarchy, motion. Nothing is decorative for its own sake.

Confidence Without Elitism
The brand is bold and self-assured, but never patronising or exclusionary.

Craft Over Clutter
Precision, restraint and editorial judgement beat excess, novelty and noise.

Brand Visual Identity

RAVE CAVE’s visual identity sits at the intersection of:

Gallery posters

Exhibition signage

Underground club culture

Editorial design

Key principles

Neutral, paper-like surfaces (white, warm beige, blush)

Black used as a typographic anchor

Neon deployed surgically as a signal, not a fill

Structured grids with asymmetry used deliberately

Cards and modals treated as collectible artefacts, not UI containers

Colour philosophy

Neon = emphasis, categorisation, moments of attitude

Neutrals = space, calm, readability, maturity

Contrast is controlled, not constant

Wine differentiation
Colour is functional and expressive, never ornamental:

Reds: confidence, depth, intensity

Whites: freshness, clarity, precision

Rosé: softness, warmth, restraint

The system should always feel cohesive, even as colour accents shift.

Brand Verbal Identity

The voice of RAVE CAVE is:

Confident

Editorial

Slightly irreverent

Calmly opinionated

It speaks like a curator, not a salesperson.

Tone characteristics

Clear, not chatty

Knowing, but not smug

Precise, not verbose

Contemporary, not trendy

Copy should:

Favour short, declarative statements

Avoid wine clichés and flowery language

Treat wine as culture, not luxury theatre

Let hierarchy and layout do as much work as words

What it avoids

SaaS buzzwords

Over-explaining

Gamification language

Forced playfulness

RAVE CAVE doesn’t beg for attention — it assumes it.

RAVE CAVE
Creative Do / Don’t Checklist
Visual Design

DO

Use neon as an accent, signal or highlight — never as a default fill

Anchor layouts with neutral, paper-like backgrounds (white, warm beige, blush)

Treat cards and modals like collectible artefacts or gallery posters

Apply strict internal grids with intentional asymmetry

Let typography carry hierarchy before colour does

Keep border weights, shadows and elevations consistent and limited

Design every screen as if it could be printed as a poster

DON’T

Flood entire surfaces with neon

Stack multiple neon colours in the same component

Use glow, blur or lighting effects as decoration

Rotate elements randomly or without purpose

Add visual noise “because it looks fun”

Treat cards as generic SaaS containers

Colour Usage

DO

Use colour to differentiate wine types clearly and consistently

Apply colour in:

edge bars

stamps and badges

underlines

ribbons

hover outlines

Keep one dominant accent per surface

Let black and neutral tones do most of the work

DON’T

Use colour purely for decoration

Mix multiple accent colours in one small area

Apply neon as a background for large text blocks

Change colour rules screen by screen

Typography

DO

Use big, confident type for names and vintages

Build a clear typographic ladder and stick to it

Pair expressive display type with restrained UI fonts

Allow breathing room — white space is part of the design

Treat typography as editorial, not functional-only

DON’T

Shrink important information to “fit more in”

Over-style type with shadows, glows or outlines

Mix too many font families or weights

Treat labels, data and content as visually equal

Motion & Interaction

DO

Use motion to signal:

focus

hierarchy

affordance

Keep motion subtle:

lift

outline change

micro-movement in badges

Make hover states feel deliberate and restrained

DON’T

Animate everything

Use arcade-style lighting or pulsing effects

Add motion without a functional reason

Let animation distract from content

Layout & System Discipline

DO

Design with systems first, expression second

Repeat patterns so the interface feels curated, not improvised

Separate viewing mode from editing mode clearly

Treat filters as curatorial tools, not utilities

DON’T

Break the system to “make one screen special”

Add new patterns without removing old ones

Overload sidebars or modals with controls

Let utility overwhelm aesthetic intent

Verbal Tone & Copy

DO

Write with confidence and restraint

Use short, declarative language

Sound like a curator, not a marketer

Trust the user’s intelligence

Let silence and layout do some of the talking

DON’T

Use SaaS clichés or feature-led language

Over-explain wine concepts

Sound playful for the sake of it

Talk down to the user or “teach” unnecessarily

Overall Principle Check

Before shipping anything, ask:

Does this feel curated or cluttered?

Is the neon doing a job, or just showing off?

Would this still feel strong in black and white?

Does this feel like an exhibition piece, not an app screen?

Is this confident enough to not explain itself?
