Its notes of \"garrigue\" (dried Mediterranean herbs), smoke, and ripe kirsch will dance beautifully with the aromatics of your braise.\n2.  **The Italian Sophisticate:** This Chianti Classico Riserva from 2016 is singing right now. Its high-toned acidity is perfect for cutting through the fat of the lamb, while the notes of leather and damp earth provide a savory backbone that mirrors the depth of a long braise.\n3.  **The Local Star:** If you prefer a Syrah, the Cullarin Block 71 is a world-class option.

Its vibrant acidity is essential for cutting through the rich, buttery texture of the Brie, while the notes of roasted hazelnut and flinty minerality will harmonize beautifully with the nutty complexity of the aged Cheddar.\n\n### For the Aged Cheddar: An Elegant Red\nIf you prefer a red, the **Riecine Riserva** is a masterpiece. Sangiovese's natural acidity and savory profile—think dried herbs, leather, and sour cherry—provide a fantastic balance to the sharp, crystalline saltiness of a well-aged Cheddar.\n\n### For the Blue Cheese: The Classic Pairing\nBlue cheese demands something that can stand up to its intensity.

To truly round out your cellar, we must look toward the \"Old World\" and a few key \"New World\" icons.\n\n### The Great Gaps: Regions to Explore\n\n**1. The Italian Renaissance (Piedmont & Tuscany)**\nYou have zero representation from Italy, *mon ami*! Given your penchant for structured reds like the **1847 Wines Grand Pappy's Shiraz** and the **Cullarin Syrah**, you must explore:\n*   **Piedmont (Nebbiolo):** Look for Barolo or Barbaresco. They offer the aromatic complexity of Pinot Noir with much firmer tannins.\n*   **Tuscany (Sangiovese):** A Chianti Classico Riserva would bring a savory, herbal dimension that is currently missing.\n\n**2. The Bordeaux Benchmarks (Left & Right Bank)**\nWhile you have a lovely **Saint-Joseph** and a touch of **Burgundy**, the power of Bordeaux is absent. \n*   **Left Bank (Cabernet-led):** For structure and \"gravelly\" mineral notes.\n*   **Right Bank (Merlot-led):** For plushness and plum-driven fruit that would sit beautifully alongside your **Amour S & M**.\n\n**3. The Effervescence (Champagne)**\n*Incroyable!* Not a single bottle of sparkling wine? Every great cellar needs the soul of **Champagne**. Whether it is a crisp *Blanc de Blancs* to match your love for Chardonnay or a rich *Vintage* bottling, this is a vital addition for celebrations.\n\n**4. The Spanish Soul (Rioja & Priorat)**\nYou appreciate the bold fruit of the Barossa. You should look toward **Rioja** (specifically *Gran Reserva*) for wines that marry American oak sweetness with earthy Tempranillo, or **Priorat** for intense, slate-driven Garnacha.\n\n**5. The American West Coast (Oregon & California)**\nSince you clearly adore cool-climate Chardonnay (your **Domaine Naturaliste** and **Derwent Estate** bottles are top-tier), you should explore:\n*   **Willamette Valley, Oregon:** For Pinot Noir that sits right between Tasmania and Burgundy in style.\n*   **Sonoma Coast, California:** For high-acid, saline Chardonnays that mirror the \"flinty\" notes you enjoy in your Australian whites.\n\n### My Sommelier Recommendation:\nStart with **Italy**. Your palate seems to favor \"vibrant acidity\" and \"flinty\" minerals in whites, and \"peppery, elegant\" profiles in reds. A **Dry Furmint from Hungary** or a **Etna Rosso (Nerello Mascalese) from Sicily** would fit your current taste profile perfectly while expanding your horizons.\n\n*Santé!* Shall we look for something specific for your next acquisition?",

Pinot Gris is a wonderful grape for beginners because it is typically very \"friendly\"—not too acidic and bursting with ripe fruit flavors. This New Zealand bottle offers lovely notes of pear and honeysuckle.\n\n### 2. The Red Choice: A Classic Australian Shiraz\nIf you prefer red, look no further than the **Murray Street Black Label Shiraz**. While some reds can be \"grippy\" or bitter for newcomers, this Barossa Shiraz is known for being rich and \"velvety.\" It tastes like dark chocolate and blackberries—it is a warm hug in a glass.\n\n```wine\n[\n  {\n    \"producer\": \"Matahiwi Estate\",\n    \"name\": \"\",\n    \"vintage\": 2022,\n    \"region\": \"Wairarapa\",\n    \"country\": \"New Zealand\",\n    \"type\": \"White\",\n    \"cepage\": \"Pinot Gris\",\n    \"rating\": 4.35,\n    \"tastingNotes\": \"Ripe pear, nectarine, honeysuckle, ginger, crisp acidity, floral\",\n    \"drinkFrom\": 2022,\n    \"drinkUntil\": 2026,\n    \"note\": \"A perfect 'starter' white. It’s aromatic and juicy without being overwhelming.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"producer\": \"Murray Street\",\n    \"name\": \"Black Label\",\n    \"vintage\": 2019,\n    \"region\": \"Barossa Valley\",\n    \"country\": \"Australia\",\n    \"type\": \"Red\",\n    \"cepage\": \"Shiraz\",\n    \"rating\": 4.3,\n    \"tastingNotes\": \"Blackberry, plum, dark chocolate, black pepper, rich, full-bodied, velvety tannins\",\n    \"drinkFrom\": 2021,\n    \"drinkUntil\": 2030,\n    \"note\": \"The quintessential Australian red.
